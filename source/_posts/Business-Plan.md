This business plan for CyberSecure Training Solutions, LLC (a completely fake and made up company, by the way), was an assignment that played a key role in my growth as a student and professional. It challenged me to think critically about both the technical and business sides of cybersecurity, combining my knowledge in the field with real-world applications. This project required me to take my skills in problem-solving and adaptability to the next level, especially as I navigated the complexities of developing a business model from the ground up.

As a result of this assignment, I gained valuable experience in structuring a comprehensive business plan, understanding market needs, and identifying how to deliver a service that could directly help small businesses—particularly in healthcare, retail, and nonprofits—mitigate cybersecurity risks. This plan demonstrates not only my technical expertise but also my ability to pivot, adapt, and apply cybersecurity knowledge to different business scenarios, a skill I’ve developed and honed throughout my college career. By crafting this detailed business strategy, I was able to explore how my technical foundation could be transformed into a solution that addresses real-world challenges in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.
