This example memo, written for my Cyber Law class, is a great showcase of how my writing has evolved to be clear, structured, and persuasive—especially in a professional setting. Framed as a formal recommendation to a fictional governor, the memo tackles complex issues like biometric data, personally identifiable information (PII), and global privacy laws (like the GDPR and CCPA), breaking them down into digestible and well-organized sections.

What really makes this piece stand out is how I tailored the argument to the audience, presenting both legal context and real-world examples to make the case for new privacy legislation. I used consistent tone and formatting, included concrete definitions and comparisons, and wrapped it up with a specific, actionable recommendation. This memo demonstrates my ability to write with purpose and precision—skills that translate across industries and are especially valuable in cybersecurity, where clear communication is just as critical as technical knowledge.
