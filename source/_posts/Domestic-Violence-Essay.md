This essay was written for my Introduction to Criminology course at Old Dominion University and explores the impact of mandatory arrest policies in domestic violence cases. I dive into both the benefits—like providing immediate protection for victims and deterring future abuse—and the concerns, such as the potential for false arrests or misuse of police resources.

Beyond the topic itself, this piece reflects how much my writing has developed during college. Compared to where I started, I’ve gotten way better at organizing ideas clearly, backing up arguments with credible sources, and tackling complex social issues with a more analytical, balanced approach. It also highlights my ability to research, think critically, and communicate effectively—skills that I’ve built steadily through my coursework.
