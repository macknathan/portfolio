This reflection essay examines my educational journey at Old Dominion University as a cybersecurity major, identifying how interdisciplinary learning contributed to my technical expertise, global perspective, and career preparedness. Through an analysis of artifacts from my portfolio, such as programming assignments, research reports, a business plan, and a public speaking video, I illustrate how my studies in law, philosophy, and communications complemented technical studies. Essential experiences, including the development of a machine learning framework for digit recognition and coursework on cyber law, compelled me to critically and ethically consider the implications of technology. While I have yet to attain a cybersecurity position, experience working as a pharmacy technician refined transferable abilities such as detail, communications, and stress management. This essay also considers how research and writing broadened knowledge regarding cybersecurity's social, legal, and philosophical implications. The outcome is a holistic education that equips me for future roles within cybersecurity, especially that of a security analyst or government position.
