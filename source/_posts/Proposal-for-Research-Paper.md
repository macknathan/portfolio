This research proposal for my Windows System Management and Security class focused on analyzing the effectiveness of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint against zero-day exploits—one of the most unpredictable threats in cybersecurity. Although I wasn’t able to complete the project in full, the work I put into developing this proposal reflects my ability to take on challenging, real-world security problems with a practical and analytical mindset.

The proposal outlines a multi-faceted research plan that involved reviewing historical data, simulating attacks in a controlled environment, and quantifying Microsoft Defender’s performance using detection rates, response times, and error rates. It also included plans for data visualization and thorough documentation, emphasizing my intent to present results clearly and professionally.

More importantly, this project pushed me to adapt. Faced with time and resource limitations, I still managed to outline a solid framework, identify credible sources, and build out a logical, methodical timeline. The experience helped me grow in how I approach large technical challenges and gave me a deeper understanding of endpoint protection tools and how to critically evaluate them—even when I couldn’t carry the project across the finish line.
