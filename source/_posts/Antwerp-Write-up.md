This analytical essay showcases my growth as a writer, especially in organizing complex technical information into a clear, structured argument. By breaking down the Port of Antwerp cyberattack, I was able to connect real-world events to broader cybersecurity principles while developing my academic voice. It reflects how my writing has maturedâ€”not just in grammar or formatting, but in critical thinking, synthesis, and the ability to explain technical topics to a broader audience.
